 The Song of the Knights of Camelot from "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"

 

Launcelot: Look, my liege!

 

(fanfare)

 

Launcelot: Camelot!

Robin: Camelot!

Galahad: Camelot!

Patsy: (whispered) It's only a model.

Galahad: Shh!

 

Arthur: Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride...to

        CAMELOT!

 

song:

 

We're knights of the round table, we dance whene're we're able.

We do routines, and border scenes, with footwork imp-e-cable;

We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spamalot.

 

We're knights of the round table, our shows are for-mid-able

Though many times, we're given rhymes, that are quite un-sing-able

We're not so bad in Camelot, we sing from the Dia-phragm alot!

 

Though we're tough and able,

Quite in-de-fa-ti-gable,

Between our quests, we seek incest and impersonate Clark Gable,

It's a busy life in Camelot:

 

I have to push the pram-a-lot!

 

Arthur: On second thought, let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place.

Others: Right, right....
