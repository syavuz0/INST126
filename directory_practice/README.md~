# This is a directory maze

The point of this set of folders is to provide a bunch of nested directories to help students practice navigating directory structure.

## Start Here

The folders are numbered roughly from "top" to "bottom", and each has a simple text file with some simple contents, to help confirm where you are at any given time.

I recommend you use the `folder5` directory as a starting place, since it's roughly in the middle of the structure, and it gives you lots of options for where to go.
