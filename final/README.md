This is my final project for INST126

This program sorts through a movie dataset dating back to 1989 with 637 entries with ratings 4.1-9.0. It filters through the genre of comedy movies based on the user input of minimum rating selection. It then lists the average rating of all movies, compared to the the average of the movies filtered by the minimum rating selection.
